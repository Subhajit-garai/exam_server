This is more flexible than purely sequential files. **Direct** Direct file organization (also known as Hashed file organization) uses a hash function to directly access a record based on a key value, allowing for fast access.  **Random** The term 'random' usually refers to access methods, not a file organization type.

BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF.\n Third Normal Form (3NF): A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and every non-key attribute is non-transitively dependent on the primary key. This means 1  that non-key attributes should depend directly on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes. While 3NF aims to reduce redundancy caused by transitive dependencies, it doesn't explicitly require every determinant to be a candidate key. There can be determinants that are not candidate keys in a 3NF table, which can still lead to some redundancy (though less than in 2NF). Since BCNF is not an option, and 3NF is the closest among the choices to addressing dependencies and determinants ",

In many memory allocation methods—such as fixed partitioning, variable partitioning, and swapping—the process must be relocated (either at load time or during movement between memory and secondary storage).However, in paging, the process’s addresses remain unchanged. This is because the CPU generates logical addresses that are split into a page number and an offset. A page table maps these logical page numbers to physical memory frames dynamically. Since the translation is handled via the page table, there is no need to alter the addresses in the process itself; the relocation is done transparently by the hardware. This is one of the advantages of paging in memory management.",
